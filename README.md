# DjangoGirls

[DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/) is a non-profit organization that empowers and helps women to organize free, one-day programming workshops by providing tools, resources and support. It was born in July 2014 in Berlin and started by two Polish girls: [Ola Sitarska](http://twitter.com/olasitarska) and [Ola Sendecka](http://twitter.com/asendecka).
